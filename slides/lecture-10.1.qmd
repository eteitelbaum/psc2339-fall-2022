    and Mexico

    -   "Three worlds" of welfare capitalism
    -   Reasons for three worlds
-   Gender and the welfare state
    -   How do welfare regimes affect women?
    -   Why are some more supportive than others?

# Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism

## Definitions and Concepts

-   *Welfare state*--system of public benefits and services that address
    human welfare needs
    -   Cash benefits
    -   Services
-   *Social rights*---rights to the provision of basic services like
    education, health care, and a basic standard of living
-   *De-commodification*---state in which a person is not dependent on
    selling her labor power in the market to ensure her survival
-   *Universalism* ---the degree to which everyone has an equal right to
    publicly provided benefits and services

## Welfare State Regimes ("Three Worlds")

-   Liberal---emphasize means tested social assistance
    -   Anglo-American countries
    -   Examples: U.S., UK, Canada, Australia...
-   Corporatist---ranked system of social insurance, emphasis on the
    family, narrow provisioning
    -   Continental European countries
    -   Examples: Austria, Germany, Switzerland
-   Social Democratic---universalistic, emphasis on full employment and
    broad provisioning (Nordic countries)
    -   Examples: Denmark, Norway, Sweden

## Pillars of Social Democracy

-   Swedish Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven
    [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRiE0ib-sjM&t=1493s)

-   Three pillars of the Nordic model
    -   Full Employment
    -   Universal and Generous Welfare System
    -   Organized Labor Market

-   Think about
    -   How each pillar is important
    -   How they work together to support the system

## Origins of Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism

-   Where do the three worlds come from?

-   Esping-Andersen (pp. 146-148)
    -   Labor unions and left parties only part of the story
    -   Emphasizes "red-green coalitions"
    -   Other factors
        -   ethnicity
        -   religion

## Discussion

- [OECD data](https://data.oecd.org/socialexp/social-spending.htm#indicator-chart)

- Explore various categories with a neighbor

- How do spending patterns relate to "three worlds" concept? 

# Gender and the Welfare State

## Gender and the Three Worlds

-   LMEs (Anglo-American countries): free market approach

-   Corporatist (Germany, Austria, Italy, etc): traditional, male
    breadwinner approach (historically, but recently more like
    Scandinavia)

-   Nordic SMEs (Scandinavia): transform gender relations; dual
    wage-earner approach

## Scandinavian Policies {.smaller}  

-   Universal public day care
-   Altered workday for parents
-   Increased parental leave
    -   Men equally entitled
    -   Norway example (46 weeks)
        -   Men and women both get 15 weeks after birth of child
        -   Women get 3 weeks before birth
        -   Then they can divide up an additional 16 weeks between them
        -   Can stretch total out to 56 weeks at 80% pay
-   Rationale: equality depends on changing men

## Discussion

-   Read [this study](https://www.unicef-irc.org/family-friendly), about
    family-friendly policies among wealth countries.

-   Countries without any requirement for paid maternity leave: Papua
    New Guinea, Swaziland, Lesotho, Liberia, the United States and some
    island nations in the South Pacific

-   How do we get to Denmark?
