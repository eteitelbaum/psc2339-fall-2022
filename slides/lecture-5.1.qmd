# What is Development?

## What is a "Developing Country?"

- World Bank Income Thresholds (GNI per capita, current US$)
	- Low-income: $1,045 or less
	- Lower middle-income: $1,046 - $4,095
	- Upper middle-income: $4,096 - $12,695
	- High income: > $12,696
- Countries that are still making rapid strides in terms of economic and human development

## Map of Income Classifications (2020)

## What is Development? 

- Economic Development: change in overall levels of wealth (growth)
	- % increase in GDP or GDP per capita
- Human Development: change in overall levels of well-being
	- Life expectancy
	- Literacy 
	- Infant mortality

# Common Approaches

## Development as Freedom (Sen)

- Poverty is “capability deprivation”
- Governments promote development when they enhance capabilities, in turn promoting freedom

## Participatory Development/Inclusive Growth

- Education and health care produce a more competitive labor force (human capital)
- Facilitates investment in industry
- Leads to broad-based “participatory” industrialization

## Sustainable Development

- Minimizing impact on environment
- Avoiding depletion of natural resources
- Considering impact of development on future generations

# Types of Distributive Politics

# Distributive Politics

## What is "Distributive Politics"? 

- The politics of how public goods and services are distributed
	- Key to human development
	- Some countries do better than others
- AKA "the politics of public service provisioning"

## Stokes et. al.–two main modes
- Programmatic
	- Distribution criteria are public
	- Criteria shape distribution of resources
- Nonprogrammatic
	- Distribution criteria not made public, or distribution influenced by private, partisan criteria

## Programmatic vs. Nonprogrammatic Distribution

![Source: Stokes et. al. *Brokers, Voters, and Clientelism*](images/stokes.png){width="70%"}

# Discussion (Groups)

## Stokes et. al. examples (each group take 1)

- Progressa/Oportunidades
- Emergency Food Aid, Argentina
- La Efectiva, Mexico
- Housing Improvement Program, Singapore

## Questions 

- What are characteristics of program in terms of:
	- Criteria for distribution
	- Linkages to electoral support
- Is the program "clientelist"?
- Is there anything like it in the U.S.? 

# Brokers

## Who are brokers? 

- Middlemen, brokers, local political bosses
- Inform politicians what voters want/need
- Provide information to and mobilize voters
- e.g. [caciques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PUtOmQCc&t=10s) (Mexico), [dalal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyoIM3JVcQY) (India), tim sukses (Indonesia)

## Problems with brokers

- Have their own agenda/ambitions
- Can do "misguided" or unexpected things
  - misuse of party funds/gifts
	- loyalty 
	- running thier own campaigns

# Examining Clientelism

## Geography of Clientelism

```{r}
#| label: clientelism-map

ne_countries(returnclass = "sf") %>%
  left_join(
    clientelism,
    by = "iso_a3"
  ) %>%
  filter(iso_a3 != "ATA") %>% # remove Antarctica
  ggplot(aes(fill = clientelism)) +
  geom_sf() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(direction = -1) +
  theme(legend.position="right") +
  labs(
    title = paste("V-Dem Clientelism Index", clientelism$year[1]),
    fill = NULL,
    caption = "Source: V-Dem Institute, Varieties of Democracy Dataset" 
  )
```

## Discussion 

- Are programmatic modes better for development than non-programmatic modes? 
  - Is one or the other more efficient?
  - Is one or the other more ethical?
  - Are brokers helpful or harmful from a developmental standpoint? 
- In your opinion, why might countries eventually shift to programmatic modes? 

## Wealth and Clientelism

```{r}
#| label: clientelism-vs-gdp
clientelism_vs_gdppc <- ggplot(clientelism_gdp, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = clientelism)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = region)) + 
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Region") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", size = 1) + 
  scale_x_log10(labels = label_dollar()) +
  aes(label = country) + # need so ggplot retains label for plotly
  labs(x= "GDP per Capita", y = "Clientelism Score",
       title = paste("Wealth and clientelism, ", clientelism_gdp$year[1]))

ggplotly(clientelism_vs_gdppc, tooltip = c("country", "clientelism")) %>%   
  # add source
  layout(annotations = list(text = "Source: The V-Dem Institute, Varities of Democracy Dataset",  
                            font = list(size = 10), showarrow = FALSE,
                            xref = 'paper', x = 1.2, xanchor = 'right', xshift = 0,
                            yref = 'paper', y = -.08, yanchor = 'auto', yshift = 0)) %>%
  # add web address
  layout(annotations = list(text = "www.psc2339.com", 
                            font = list(size = 10, color = 'grey'), showarrow = FALSE,
                            xref = 'paper', x = .5, xanchor = 'center', xshift = 0,
                            yref = 'paper', y = 1, yanchor = 'top', yshift = 0)) 
```

## Changes Over Time

```{r}
#| label: time-series
ggplot(clientelism_ts, aes(x = year, y = clientelism, color = region)) + 
  geom_line(size = 1) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2", name = "Region") +
  labs(x= NULL, y = "Clienelism",        
       title = "Clientelism Trends by Region", 
       caption = "Source: V-Dem Institute")
```

# Conclusion

## Conclusion

- Development
	- Economic, human
- Distributive politics
	- Programmatic
	- Nonprogrammatic
	- Brokers
- Implications
  - Clientelism declines with wealth 
  - But changes slow to occur
