# What is Backsliding

## Regime Types

-   Democracies
    -   Free and fair elections
    -   Protection of civil liberties
-   Hybrid regimes (illiberal, semi-authoritarian)
    -   Elections, degree of fairness in question
    -   More restricted civil liberties
-   Authoritarian regimes
    -   No elections, or rigged elections
    -   No basic rights and liberties

## Democratic (or Authoritarian) Backsliding

"\[A\] decline in the quality of democracy, when it occurs within
democratic regimes, or in democratic qualities of governance in
autocracies."

> Lust and Waldman

## Regime Type Trends

```{r}
ggplot(pct_regimes, aes(x = year, y = percent, color = regime_type)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Percent", 
       title = "Trends in Regime Type, 1975 - Present\n") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2", name = "Regime Type") 
```

## Examples

![](images/top10.png){width="50%"}

## Common Mechanisms

-   Constitutional amendments to enhance executive authority
-   Elimination of checks and balances, reduction of accountability
-   Centralization of executive power through purges
-   Intimidation of media and civil society
-   Elimination of political competition
    -   attacks on competitors
    -   rigged elections

## Methods of Backsliding (Bormeo)

-   Old Way
    -   Open-ended coups
    -   Executive coups
    -   Vote fraud
-   New Way
    -   Promissory coups
    -   Executive aggrandizement
    -   Strategic harassment and manipulation

# Discussion

## U.S. in Comparative Perspective

-   Kaufman and Haggard reading
-   How has backsliding occurred in middle-income countries?
-   How similar is the U.S. to these countries?
-   Is electoral authoritarianism possible in the U.S.?

# Theories of Backsliding

## Hypotheses (1/3)

-   Leadership
    -   State strength and autonomy (how leaders create it)
    -   Role of elites in negotiating transitions, dividing power
-   Culture
    -   Civic culture
    -   Social capital and education

## Hypotheses (2/3) {style="font-size: .75em"}

-   Specific types of political institutions
    -   Presidential vs. parliamentary systems
    -   Consociationalism (for divided societies)
    -   Electoral institutions
        -   PR vs SMD
        -   If PR type of lists
        -   Party fragmentation and instability (e.g. Indonesia)
-   International factors
    -   International orgs (foreign aid, election monitoring,
        etc.)
    -   Alliances (who are your friends?)
    
## Hypotheses (3/3)

-   Social structures
    -   Class (bourgeoisie, working class, etc.)
    -   Ethnic fragmentation
        -   Relevance of economic and political exclusion
-   Economic factors (see below)

# Political Economy of Backsliding

## Wealth

-   Exogenous Democratization
-   Rising wealth makes backsliding less likely
-   "No democracy was ever subverted in a country with a per capita
    income higher than Argentina in 1975: \$6,055" (Przeworski)

## Inequality {style="font-size: .75em"}

-   "Redistributivist" theory
    -   Democracy is more durable in egalitarian societies
-   When the poor demand redistribution of elite's wealth, elites react
    by "digging in their heels" because redistribution would be too
    drastic (Acemoglu and Robinson 2006)
-   Demands for redistribution are less in societies with lower
    inequality and societies where assets of elites are mobile (Boix
    2003) 
-   Competition from rising elites (Ansell and Samuels 2014)

## Macroeconomic Performance

-   Literature especially focused on growth and inflation (Kapstein and
    Converse)
    -   High growth rates $\rightarrow$ less risk of backsliding
    -   High inflation increases risk
-   Arguably more about regime stability than democracy
    -   Applies equally well to authoritarian regimes
    -   High performing autocracies likely to survive
    -   "Performance legitimacy", e.g. China

## Natural resource wealth

-   Undermines democracy
-   Promotes authoritarianism
-   Focus of next week's discussion

# Exercise

## Group Exercise {style="font-size: .75em"}

-   [V-Dem graphing tool](https://www.v-dem.net/en/online-graphing/)

-   Interactive Map Tool
    -   One variable multiple countries
    -   Look at electoral democracy and one other variable

-   Variable Graph
    -   One variable, compare two countries
    -   Zoom in on one country from the map

-   Country Graph
    -   One country, multiple variables
    -   Start with electoral democracy and expand

\*\* What interesting patterns/questions arise?
