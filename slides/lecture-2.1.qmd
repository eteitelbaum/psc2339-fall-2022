# Institutions

## What is an Institution?

"Humanly devised constraints that structure political, economic and
social interaction. They consist of both informal constraints
(sanctions, taboos, customs, traditions and codes of conduct), and
formal rules (constitutions, laws, property rights)."

    - *Douglas North*

## Inclusive Institutions

-   Inclusive institutions..."allow and encourage participation by the
    great mass of people in economic activities that make the best use
    of their talents and skills and enable individuals to make the
    choices they wish."
-   *Economic*: private property, unbiased legal system, banks, legally
    binding contracts, etc.
-   *Political*: can take a variety of forms but must be pluralistic
    (constrained) with centralized and powerful state

## Extractive Institutions

-   Extractive institutions are..."designed to extract incomes and
    wealth from one subset of society to benefit a different subset."
-   *Economic*: limited or non-existent property rights, biased legal
    system, slavery
-   *Political*: absolutist, repressive, may or may not be centralized

## Key Arguments

-   *Hypothesis 1*: Inclusive **economic** institutions promote
    investment and economic growth, while extractive institutions
    discourage investment and hamper economic growth

-   *Hypothesis 2*: Inclusive **political** institutions encourage the
    development of inclusive economic institutions and vice-versa

# Additional Considerations

## Distribution of Authority

![Acemoglu & Robinson, figure 3](images/AR_fig3.png){width="70%"}

::: notes
-   Institutional change/progress depends on distributed authority
-   Pulls power away from monarch/dictator
-   Broad coalitions counter narrow interests
:::

## Persistence and Change

-   Why do extractive institutions persist?
    -   Industrial progress threatens the interests of dictators and
        other elites
    -   Polany's "double movement"
    -   Schumpeter's theory of "creative destruction"
-   When do institutions change?
    -   Critical junctures (and small differences)
    -   e.g. disease $\rightarrow$ shift in labor market dynamics
    -   Revolution gives a group new power

::: notes
-   A&R give the example of bubonic plague leading to shift in labor
    market dynamics
    -   Maybe something similar is going on with COVID?
-   Revolution leads to assertion of power for one class or another
    -   Glorious Revolution lead to permanent assertion of power of
        parliament over the crown
    -   French revolution led to greater power for lower classes,
        established constitution that limited power of the monarchy
    -   Other examples?
:::

## Reversal of Fortunes

-   Extractive institutions make a region wealthy in one period, but
    poor in the next
-   Examples?

::: notes
slavery; the encomienda system (forced labor); child labor

## Zimbabwe, South Africa & China

Discuss in this order: Zimbabwe, South Africa and China Use China to
transition to growth under dictatorship

If things are going fast, do small groups; have each choose on case for
discussion.

# Growth Under Dictators

All three are dictators; did their countries grow at the same rate under
their leadership?

```

::: notes
How do we explain variation in growth rates under repressive regimes?

DRC is purely extractive; USSR directs resources towards productive
sectors; while South Korea (and China) adopt inclusive political
institutions
:::

## Growth Under Repressive Regimes

-   Growth under extractive institutions is possible
    -   When elite funnel resources to high productivity areas
    -   When authoritarian regimes permit inclusive economic
        institutions
-   But this growth is inherently *limited*
    -   Lack of incentives for innovation and production
    -   Resistance to creative destruction
    -   Infighting among the elite

# Remaining Challenges

::: notes
-   India's fortunes as a global power declined under the British
-   India had the world's leading economy until the 18th century
-   India's share of the global economy feel from 24% of global GDP to
    around 4% when the British left
-   India saw a decline under the British until the middle of the 19th
    century, at which point it began to grow again, but the growth was
    uneven and steady upward growth only resumed after the British left
-   India's economy stagnated because the British extracted raw
    materials and sold finished products (mainly textiles and garments)
    back to India as a captive market
-   The British eenacted laws that prevented Indian industry from
    competing with British imports, killing India's textile sector,
    which it had a huge comparative advantage in before the British
    arrived
-   There are some caveats:
    -   Although its GDP was lower, India grew at a faster pace under
        the British than under the Mughals
    -   Mughals were also pretty brutal as far as rulers go and hoarded
        most of India's wealth
    -   The Mughal empire was already on the decline when the British
        came
-   However the fact remains that the British adoped and heavily relied
    upon extractive institutions to transfer wealth back to Britain
:::

## Endogeneity

-   A relationship is "endogenous" when the direction of causality is
    unclear
-   A&R hypothesize that inclusive institutions drive development
-   But could inclusive institutions be the result of development?
-   Or could there be a third factor driving both?
    -   What are some possibilities?

## Exercise

-   Write two or three sentences on what you found convincing about
    A&R's theory
-   Write two or three sentences on what you found problematic
-   Discuss with a neighbor
