# Overview

## Central Questions

-   What is the resource curse?
    -   "Dutch Disease"
    -   "Four S's"
-   Policy solutions
-   Breaking down the resource curse
    -   Democracy, accountability, gender, conflict
-   Much of the discussion will focus on oil
    -   But many of the arguments also apply to other resources

# The "Resource Curse"

## What is The Resource Curse?

-   The combined political and economic effects of natural resource
    wealth
    -   Low growth, particularly in industry
    -   Low accountability and high corruption
    -   Volatility in government revenues
    -   Entrenched patriarchy
    -   Political instability and conflict (civil wars)
    -   Adverse implications for democracy and democratic transitions
        (our main focus)

## Oil and Electoral Democracy

```{r}
oil_democracy <- ggplot(oil_curse, aes(x = oil_inc_pc, y = polyarchy)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = region)) + 
  aes(label = country) +  # need so ggplot retains label for plotly
  scale_x_log10(labels = function(x) format(x, scientific = FALSE)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", size = .75) + 
  labs(x= "Oil Income Per Capita", y = "Polyarchy Score",       
       title = "Oil Wealth and Democracy, 1860 - 2006") +
  guides(color=guide_legend(title="Region"))

ggplotly(oil_democracy, tooltip = c("country", "polyarchy", "oil_inc_pc")) %>%   
  # add source
  layout(annotations = list(text = "Source: The V-Dem Institute, Varities of Democracy Dataset",  
                            font = list(size = 10), showarrow = FALSE,
                            xref = 'paper', x = 1, xanchor = 'right', xshift = 0,
                            yref = 'paper', y = -.1, yanchor = 'auto', yshift = 0)) %>%
  # add web address
  layout(annotations = list(text = "www.psc2339.com", 
                            font = list(size = 10, color = 'grey'), showarrow = FALSE,
                            xref = 'paper', x = .5, xanchor = 'center', xshift = 0,
                            yref = 'paper', y = 1, yanchor = 'top', yshift = 0)) 
```

## Ross Discussion

-   What is a "fiscal theory of democracy" and what does it have to do
    with the oil curse?
-   See graph on previous slide
  - Which country cases support Ross's theory?
  - Which countries are exceptions?  

## Oil and the "Four S's"

-   Source (rentier effect)
    -   Non-tax revenues
    -   Lack of accountability
-   Scale
    -   Spending
    -   Repression
-   Secrecy (corruption)
-   Stability (revenue)

## Dutch Disease

-   Decline of export sectors when a natural resource is discovered
-   Deindustrialization
    -   Poor allocation of resources (investment)
    -   Government crowds out private sector
-   Higher exchange rates
    -   Hurt competitiveness of industrial sector
    -   May lead to protectionist policies

# Resource Geography

## Where are the Resoruces?

[Who Makes Energy?](https://www.eia.gov/international/rankings/world?)

[Who Has the Oil?](https://www.eia.gov/international/data/world/petroleum-and-other-liquids/annual-crude-and-lease-condensate-reserves)

<br><br>

Follow the links to the U.S. Energy Information Agency website above.
For the first link, play the ranking animation. For the second, select heat map and play the map animation. Discuss with a neighbor. Any surprises?

## Resource Production as % of GDP

```{r }
oil_rent_graph <- ggplot(data = rents) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = oil_rents_gdp), 
          position = "identity") + 
  labs(fill ="Oil Rents (% GDP)") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "viridis")

oil_rent_graph + theme_map() + 
  labs(title = "Oil Dependence, 1970 - present", 
       caption = "Source: World Band Development Indicators")
```

# Policy Alternatives

## Policy Discussion

-   Leaving oil in ground
-   Barter contracts (oil for public goods)
-   Distribute more oil revenues to citizens
-   Transfer more money to regional or local governments
-   Privatize (and tax) oil sector
-   Stabilization funds
-   Borrowing counter-cyclically
-   Enhancing transparency

# Heterogeneous Effects

## Oil and Democracy by Region

```{r}
het_effects <- ggplot(oil_curse, aes(x = oil_inc_pc, y = polyarchy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  aes(label = country) + 
  scale_x_log10(labels = function(x) format(x, scientific = FALSE)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", size = .75) + 
  facet_wrap(~ region) + 
  labs(x= "Oil Income Per Capita", y = "Electoral Democracy",        
       title = "The Heterogeneous Effects of Oil Wealth", 
       caption = "Source: V-Dem Institute")

ggplotly(het_effects, tooltip = c("country", "polyarchy", "oil_inc_pc")) %>%   
  # add source
  layout(annotations = list(text = "Source: The V-Dem Institute, Varities of Democracy Dataset",  
                            font = list(size = 10), showarrow = FALSE,
                            xref = 'paper', x = 1, xanchor = 'right', xshift = 0,
                            yref = 'paper', y = -.1, yanchor = 'auto', yshift = 0)) %>%
  # add web address
  layout(annotations = list(text = "www.psc2339.com", 
                            font = list(size = 10, color = 'grey'), showarrow = FALSE,
                            xref = 'paper', x = .5, xanchor = 'center', xshift = 0,
                            yref = 'paper', y = 1, yanchor = 'top', yshift = 0))
```

## Heterogeneous Effects

-   Oil may have destabilizing effect in some regions but not others
-   Theories
    -   Degree of resource dependence

    -   Levels of inequality (Dunning)

    -   Experience with democracy (Ross)

    -   Industrial policy (Brooks and Kurtz)

## Latin American "Exceptionalism"

-   Oil wealth and democracy are both endogenous to industrialization
    -   Oil exploration requires investments in human capital

    -   These investments are made as part of ISI policies (e.g. Brazil)

        -   ISI = Import Substitution Industrialization

    -   Industrialization, in turn, leads to democracy
-   Extension of modernization theory
-   What about Venezuela?

# Extensions

## Oil and Patriarchy (Theory)

## Oil and Patriarchy (Evidence)

![*Source*: Ross, The Oil Curse, Chapter 4](images/seats_parliament.png)

## Oil and Conflict (Theory)

-   Costs vs. benefits of rebellion
    -   Costs: repression; opportunity costs
    -   Benefits: winning power; patronage from new leaders (if you win)
-   Expected benefits \> costs in oil-producing regions
    -   Incentives frequently lead to separatist wars
    -   Spoils of war greater for aspiring leaders

## Oil and Conflict (Evidence)
