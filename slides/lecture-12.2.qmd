# Inequality

## Illustrative statistics from Stiglitz 

- 20% of wage earners earn as much as bottom 80%
- Top 1% earn in a week what bottom 20% earns in a year
- Top .1% earn in a day what bottom 90% earns in a year
- Walton family controls as much wealth as is owned by bottom 30% of society (~$238 billion)

## Common Inequality Measures {.smaller}

- Income/wealth shares
	-What share a given subpopulation accounts for 
- Ratios
	- 20/20 ratio (highest 20/lowest 20)
	- Palma ratio (highest 10/lowest 40)
	- 90/10 ratio (lowest 90/highest 10)
- Gini coefficient
	- Based on the “Lorenz” curve
	- Varies from 0 to 1
- Others
	- e.g. Thiel, Hoover

## Lorenze Curve and Gini Coefficient

::: columns
:::: column
- Gini coefficient is A/(A+B)
- Varies from 0 (perfect equality) and 1 (perfect inequality)

## Income vs. Wealth Inequality

- Income: what people earn from work and *returns* from investments like stocks, bonds and investment properties 
- Wealth: value of everything a person or family owns minus any debts
	- Net worth: marketable assets minus debts
	- Financial wealth: non-home wealth

## Decomposing the 1%

  		  x = "Year", y = "Top Share")
```

::: {.notes}
Top 1% as a whole see increased wealth shares of about 15% from 1975 to now, 
while top .5% doubles its wealth share; .1% and .01% tripple their wealth shares.

- Country graphs section
- Select a country
	- Canada
	- United Kingdom
	- Germany
	- France
	- Sweden
	- China
	- India
- How have pre-tax income shares changed over time? 
- How does your country compare to the world and the U.S. in terms of shares of top 10%

# Explanations

## Pickety vs. Stiglitz

- Pickety: r > g
  - There is some truth to "r > g" in the U.S.
    - Most people do not have a lot of non-home wealth
  - But upward slope of inequality sharper in U.S.
- Stiglitz: "rent seeking"
  - CEOs pay themselves rather than paying workers
  - Rent is drawing income by capturing something 
    - As opposed to producing something of value
    - Grabbing wealth vs. creating wealth

## Other Explanations {.smaller}

- Economic globalization
	- Trade
	- Internationalization of finance 
- Conservative economic policy (Regan revolution)
	- Removal of capital controls 
	- Deregulation
	- Shifts in tax policy
- Technology and skill development 
	- Reduced demand for low-skilled workers
- Immigration
- Social norms and reward system
- Decline of left parties and unions
- Lack of redistribution

## Debate: Should Big Tech be Broken Up

- Pick one of the FAANG companies 
  - Facebook (Meta)
  - Amazon
  - Apple
  - Netflix
  - Google (Alphabet)
- Should it be broken up into smaller companies?
  - Winners and losers
  - Relate your argument to inequality/Stiglitz
