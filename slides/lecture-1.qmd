# Overview

## Polanyi's Obejctives

-   Explain rise of fascism, political instability and war
-   Advance an argument about negative effects of economic liberalism
-   Provide an alternative vision of the economy's place in society
-   Defend market regulation as not inherently "leftist"

# The Self-Regulating Market

## The "Invisible Hand"

-   19th century economic liberalism
    -   Ricardo/Smith
-   An economy directed by market prices and nothing but market prices
-   Polanyi calls it a "dangerous fantasy"
-   Tremendous amount of bureaucracy/governance required to maintain
    free markets

## State of Nature I

-   For Smith, our nature is to "truck, barter and trade"
-   For Polanyi, we are communal by nature
-   Markets have always played some role in society but not the dominant
    role
-   Importance of ethnography
    -   Evidence-based approach
    -   Not just a rhetorical device

## State of Nature II

-   Trobriand Islanders (Papua New Guinea)
-   People motivated by status more than money
    -   Money is a means to and end
-   Money not that relevant for distribution
    -   Reciprocity
    -   Redistribution
    -   Householding

## Discussion

-   What is your view of the state of nature?
-   Is it more similar to Karl Polanyi's or Adam Smith's?

# The Birth of Liberalism

## Where Did Liberalism Come From?

-   Does not date back to Smith or Ricardo
-   These thinkers were ahead of their time
-   Emerged out of class politics following industrial revolution

::: notes
Liberalism is a relatively recent ideology/practice
:::

## Elements of Liberalism

-   Unfettered labor market
    -   Cheap labor for industry
-   Gold standard
    -   Facilitated trade
    -   Kept prices in check
-   Free trade
    -   Industrialists/traders wanted to access raw materials
    -   Facilitated by the gold standard

::: notes
Liberalism was dopted to suit needs of industry and instability in the
international economy Needs: price stability, cheap labor, raw materials
:::

## The Gold Standard (1879-1973)

-   Pegging the value of the dollar to gold
-   Problems
    -   Deflationary: could not print money in excess of gold supply
    -   Led to dramatic boom-bust cycles
-   Reforms
    -   1931: Roosevelt ends gold standard domestically
    -   1971: Nixon ends Bretton Woods

::: notes
The gold standard was problematic because it prevented the government
from undertaking monetary policy to counteract economic downturns

## Discussion

-   Polanyi argues that economic liberalism generates political
    instability
-   Looking at the graph, do you see the connection?
-   Can you also find evidence challenging Polanyi's view?

# The "Double Movement"

## Small Groups

-   Review the concept of the double movement as it is presented in
    Chapter 11 of *The Great Transformation*
-   What does Polanyi mean by a "movement" and a "counter-movement"?
-   Who are the actors involved?
    -   Who is affected by this "movement"
    -   What does the "counter-movement" entail?

## Description of Double Movement

-   Movement: expansion of liberalism and self-regulating markets
-   Counter-movement: reaction of society against dislocation caused by
    markets
-   New regulations
    -   Purpose is to shelter land, labor and the money supply against
        "devastating effects" of policies used to sustain
        self-regulating markets
    -   Importance of class dynamics: winners and losers

## Who are the Opponents of Liberalism?

-   Not a unified, hegemonic left or an anti-liberal ideology
-   Responses are rather piecemeal
    -   Regulation arises in many areas
    -   Across many countries
    -   In response to similar problems
-   Regulation is a result of liberalism's failure, not its cause

## Small Groups

-   Can Polanyi's theory of the "double movement" be applied to
    contemporary politics?
-   Provide at least two concrete examples to support your view
    -   Be sure to identify
        -   The "movement"
        -   The "countermovement"
        -   The actors involved, e.g. winners and losers
