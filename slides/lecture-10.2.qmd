# The Effects of Globalization

## Three Theories

- Race to the bottom hypothesis
	- Globalization induces states to drastically reduce publicly provided benefits and services
- Embedded liberalism hypothesis
	- Globalization induces states to spend more on benefits and services to cushion workers from increased labor market risks
- Convergence
	- Globalization forces states to provide similar levels and types of benefits and services

## Reasons for Persistence

- Trade openness—induces countries to spend more to cushion workers (embedded liberalism)
- Partisan politics—Christian democratic and social Democratic parties favor welfare state (but different kinds)
- Electoral politics (voters like programs)
- Bureaucratic inertia (vested interests)
- Economic coordination (next week)
