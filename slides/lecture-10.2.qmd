# The Effects of Globalization

## Three Theories

- Race to the bottom hypothesis
	- Globalization induces states to drastically reduce publicly provided benefits and services
- Embedded liberalism hypothesis
	- Globalization induces states to spend more on benefits and services to cushion workers from increased labor market risks
- Convergence
	- Globalization forces states to provide similar levels and types of benefits and services

![*Notes*: Data are from World Bank Development Indicators. Social democratic countries include Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Norway,  and Sweden; Corporatist countries include Austria, France, Germany and Italy; Liberal countries include Australia, Canada, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, the UK, and the U.S.](images/education_spending.jpg)

## Reasons for Persistence

- Trade openness—induces countries to spend more to cushion workers (embedded liberalism)
- Partisan politics—Christian democratic and social Democratic parties favor welfare state (but different kinds)
- Electoral politics (voters like programs)
- Bureaucratic inertia (vested interests)
- Economic coordination (next week)
