# Public Goods

## What is a Public Good? 

- **Non-excludable:** can’t restrict use once provided  

- **Non-rival (jointly supplied):** once available, can be consumed by others at no additional cost

- Opposite of a private good, distinct from “club goods” and “common pool resources”

## Examples

![](images/examples.png)

## Relevance 

- Public goods associated with programmatic politics
- Clientelism associated with club goods and private benefits

## Geography of Clientelism

```{r}
#| label: clientelism-map

map <- ne_countries(returnclass = "sf") %>%
  left_join(
    clientelism,
    by = "iso_a3"
  ) %>%
  filter(iso_a3 != "ATA") %>% # remove Antarctica
  ggplot(aes(fill = clientelism)) + # need ctry label for plotly to show in tool tip 
                                    # (fill = clientelism, label = country)
                                    # but couldn't get all ctry names to show, so I left it
  geom_sf() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(direction = -1) +
  theme(legend.position="right") +
  labs(
    title = paste("V-Dem Clientelism Index", clientelism$year[1]),

  )

                                                         # but left code here to try in future
  style(hoveron = "fill")  %>%
# add source
  layout(annotations = list(text = "Source: The V-Dem Institute, Varities of Democracy Dataset",  
                            font = list(size = 10), showarrow = FALSE,
                            xref = 'paper', x = 1, xanchor = 'right', xshift = 0,
                            yref = 'paper', y = -.1, yanchor = 'auto', yshift = 0)) %>%
  # add web address

::: notes
- On the whole SE Asia is pretty clientelistic, but there are some bright spots
in terms of social programs. 
- Lets take a moment to explore some of these. 
:::

# Social Spending in SE Asia

## Embedded Liberalism  

- *Embedded liberalism*: spending on social programs to generate and maintain popular support for liberal economic policies
- 1990s—emphasis on neoliberal “Washington Consensus” policies
	- Get the macroeconomics right, rest will follow
	- “Trickle down” economics
- This consensus was challenged by Asian Financial Crisis of 1997

## Asian Financial Crisis

- Showed that even in rapidly growing region, poor remained vulnerable to economic shocks
- In Indonesia, half the population was vulnerable to food price shocks and rising unemployment
- Since the turn of millennium, policymakers have focused on building safety nets for the vulnerable
- Shift in thinking affected policy affected almost every region: Latin America, Africa, South and SE Asia

## Welfare States in Developing Countries

- Noncontributory social assistance
	- Direct transfers, frequently conditional
- Social insurance
	- Protection against loss of employment
- Health care schemes
- Labor market policies
	- Minimum wage, terms and conditions of work, resolution of industrial disputes, etc.
- Education spending

## Southeast Asia Examples 

- Malaysia
  - [Universal healthcare](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/11/5/e047126) alongside private system
  - Free primary and junior secondary education
- Thailand
  - ["30-bhat scheme"](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/thailand-gave-healthcare-to-its-entire-population-and-the-results-were-dramatic/)
  - Free education through secondary school

## 

- Indonesia 
  - [Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN)](https://staff.ui.ac.id/system/files/users/pratiwi.sudarmono/publication/pratiwiunivesallancet2018.pdf)
  - Universal healthcare scheme introduced in 2014
  - Covers > 200 million people, largest single payer scheme in the world (Augustina et. al. 2019)


# Vote Buying in Indonesia 

## Discussion

- What is a "success team"?
- How does clientelism in Indonesia differ from clientelism in Latin America?
  - What changed in 1999?
- What is a "ground war" and how is it fought? 
- When is vote buying successful? What does it achieve?

# Electoral Systems

## Closed and Open-list PR

- PR versus SMD
- Closed-list PR (most systems)
	- Party controls who is on list, and ranking of candidates
	- Generates loyalty to party
- Open-list PR (Indonesia)
	- Vote for individuals not parties
	- Candidates with most votes get seats

## Ballot Example

![2014 DPR (People's Representative Council) ballot for Bali. One punch for party and one for a candidate](images/ballot1.jpg)

## Election Results

# Brokers 

## Tim Sukses

- "Success teams"
- Important due to general weakness of parties
- Hierarchical, pyramid-like structures 
- Brokers are notoriously unreliable
	- Predation, defection, duplicity

## Effectiveness	

- Base areas 
  - *Tim sukses*, vote buying more effective 
  - But required to stay relevant 
- In non-base areas
  - Community gifts and become more important
  - Success depends on influence of community leaders 
  - Quid pro quo is expected but difficult to enforce

## Comparisons

- Argentina
- India
  - North vs. South
- Sub-Saharan Africa
  - Similar variation
- Hypothesis: clientelism is stronger where parties are weaker

# Exercise

- Split up into groups
- Plan a ground war for Arief Wismansyah
- What are your targets and expected results?
- How would you...
  - Organize success teams
  - Decide on number of brokers to recruit
  - Pay and manage brokers
  - Choose level of funding and types of gifts

# Conclusion

## Conclusion

- Public goods
- Social spending in SE Asia
- Indonesia case
	- Electoral system
	- Vote-buying vs. club goods
	- Success of clientelist strategies
- Discussion/Q&A
