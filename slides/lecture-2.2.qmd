# Modernization Theory

## What is Modernization Theory?

-   Based on observation by Lipset (1959)
-   Noted that democracy is highly correlated with development
-   Took on guise of causal argument
    -   Wealth â†’ democracy
    -   Led to decades of debate

## Some Stylized Facts

-   Wealthier countries tend to be more democratic
-   Relationship tends to be stronger before WWII
-   There also tend to be big regional differences
    -   In some regions the relationship is evident
    -   In others, not as much

## Thinking About the Data

-   Which countries fall on the line in the two graphs?
-   Which are outliers?
-   Which countries move into the southeast quadrant?
    -   Why is that significant?
-   Find your favorite country.
    -   Is it where you thought it would be?

# Detour: Measuring Democracy

## The V-Dem Institute

-   Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem)
-   Polyarchy score
    -   Robert Dahl
    -   Polyarch--form of government in which power is vested in
        multiple people
-   V-Dem's polyarch index is based on concept of electoral democracy

## Electoral Democracy

Electoral Democracy: "seeks to embody the core value of making rulers
responsive to citizens, achieved through electoral
competition...\[P\]olitical and civil society organizations can operate
freely, elections are clean..and affect the composition of the chief
executive."

## Other Ways to Think About Democracy

Liberal Democracy: "emphasizes the importance of protecting individual
and minority rights against the tyranny of the state and the tyranny of
the majority...judges the quality of democracy by the limits placed on
government."

<br>

Participatory Democracy: "emphasizes active participation by citizens in
all political processes, electoral and non-electoral.." and "engagement
in civil society organizations, direct democracy, and subnational
elected bodies."

## Democracy and Development by Region

```{r}
#| label: by_region
region_plot <- ggplot(polyarchy_postwar, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, size = .75) + 
  facet_wrap(~ region) + 
  scale_x_log10(labels = label_dollar()) +
  aes(label = country) + # need to retain label to give to plotly
  #geom_text(hjust = 0, nudge_x = .2, size = 1.5, aes(label = country_name)) +
  labs(x= "GDP Per Capita", y = "Polyarchy Score",
       title = "Wealth and democracy by region after WWII")

ggplotly(region_plot, tooltip = c("country", "polyarchy")) %>%   
  # add source
  layout(annotations = list(text = "Source: The V-Dem Institute, Varities of Democracy Dataset",  
                            font = list(size = 10), showarrow = FALSE,
                            xref = 'paper', x = 1, xanchor = 'right', xshift = 0,
                            yref = 'paper', y = -.1, yanchor = 'auto', yshift = 0)) %>%

                            xref = 'paper', x = .5, xanchor = 'center', xshift = 0,
                            yref = 'paper', y = 1, yanchor = 'top', yshift = 0))
```

## Thinking About the Data

-   Where is the relationship strongest?
-   Where is it weakest?
-   Why is the relationship stronger or weaker in some places?
-   What are some regional outliers? Why are they different?

## Democracy and Development Over Time

                            xref = 'paper', x = 1, xanchor = 'right', xshift = 100,
                            yref = 'paper', y = -.1, yanchor = 'auto', yshift = 0)) %>%

                            yref = 'paper', y = 1, yanchor = 'top', yshift = 0))
```

## Thinking About the Data

-   Pick your favorite era
-   Was this era more or less democratic than modernization theory would
    predict?
-   Does this surprise you?

# More Theory

## Endogenous Democratization

-   Democracy is a direct *consequence* of economic development
-   Synonymous with modernization theory
    -   *Endogenous*--coming from within
    -   Democracy is a result of wealth
-   Mechanisms
    -   Industrialization
    -   Urbanization
    -   Rise of middle class
    -   Education

## Exogenous Democratization

-   *Exogenous*--resulting from an external cause
-   Wealth does not cause democracy
-   But democracy is more easily sustained in wealthy countries
    (Przeworski et. al.)
-   Mechanisms unclear (Boix & Stokes)

# More Recent Trends

## Are the Wealthiest Countries Democratic?

```{r}
#| label: wealthiest1 
ggplot(biggest, aes(y = fct_reorder(country, gdp), x = gdp)) +  
  geom_col(fill = "red") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0("$", x/1000000000000, " ", "Trillion")) +
  labs(x = "\nGDP (constant 2015 US$)", y = NULL, 
       title = "The fifteen largest economies by GDP", 
       caption = "\nSource: The World Bank, World Development Indicators, Retrieved from DataBank")
```

## In terms of Purchasing Power Parity...

```{r}
#| label: wealthiest2 
ggplot(biggest_ppp, aes(y = fct_reorder(country, gdp_ppp), x = gdp_ppp)) +  
  geom_col(fill = "red") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0("$", x/1000000000000, " ", "Trillion")) +
  labs(x = "\nGDP, PPP (constant 2017 International $)", y = NULL, 
       title = "The fifteen largest economies by GDP in terms of PPP", 
       caption = "\nSource: The World Bank, World Development Indicators, Retrieved from DataBank") 
```

## Thinking About the Data

-   Discuss the differences between GDP and nominal terms
-   Do you think the most recent data support modernization theory?
-   Or is exogenous theory more convincing?

::: notes
How would we make sense of A&R's cases in light of today's discussion?
A&R clearly want to discount modernization theory: institutions come
first for A&R But then how do inclusive institutions and strong states
emerge? Can we resolve the contradictions among these three theories:
A&R, modernization, endogenous democratization?
