# Diversity and Collective Action

## Collective Action and Public Goods

-   Because they are non-excludable, public goods and common pool
    resources threatened by collective action problems (CAPs)
    -   Public goods = socially beneficial
    -   Individuals have incentives to free-ride
-   Tragedy of the commons
    -   Large-scale illustration of collective action problem
-   Prisoner's dilemma
    -   Small-scale illustration of collective action problem

## Diversity and Public Provisioning

-   Macro-level studies find a robust negative correlation between
    ethnic heterogeneity and public goods provisioning
    -   Seminal study: Alesina, Baqir, and Easterly 1999
-   Micro-level studies find that shared identity promotes collective
    action among "coethnics," and prevents cooperation among
    "non-coethnics"
-   What explains this relationship? What links ethnic diversity and
    public goods provisioning?

## The Central Issue

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Ethnicity turns public goods into club goods
-   Collective action occurring at the level of the ethnic group, not at
    the level of society as a whole

# Economic Theories

## 1. Selective Incentives

-   Collective action is more likely with the right set of incentives
-   "Selective incentives" are incentives targeted at individuals to
    make participation advantageous and non-participation
    disadvantageous (Olson)
    -   Inducements--positive incentives
    -   Constraints--negative incentives
-   Ethnic groups may be better at devising and applying selective
    incentives than other groups or institutions
    -   Expectations of reciprocity
    -   Ability to sanction through informal institutions

## 2. Size of Groups

-   Coordination problems are even bigger among large groups (Olson)
    -   "Action taking groups" tend to be much smaller than "non-action
        taking groups"
    -   Examples: committees in Congress, partners in a small company,
        executives, lobbyists, unions
    -   Versus broad classes of people (working-class; citizens;
        shareholders in a large company)
-   Why? Distribution of gains versus costs of collective action
-   Ethnic groups are a smaller subset of society
    -   Thus a more viable "action-taking" group
    -   Think here about public provisioning at the **local** (e.g.
        village) level

## 3. Contract Theory

-   Basic problem: when 'a' contracts with 'b', how does 'a' know that
    'b' will follow through?
-   In developing countries, governments often lack enforcement capacity
-   Ethnic groups help overcome deficits of government institutions
    -   Informational shortcuts (e.g. "I trust her because she is from
        my community.")
    -   By compensating for reputation and trust deficits through dense
        social networks (e.g. "We are from the same village and people
        say that she is trustworthy.")

# The Role of Politics

## Explaining Variation

-   Correlation between ethnic diversity and service provisioning is not
    absolute
-   We see substantial cross-national variation in how much ethnicity
    matters
-   We also see lots of sub-national variation
-   How do we explain this variation?

## Subnationalism

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   *Subnationalism*: a form of group identification based on language
    or regional culture
-   Subnational identity increases public support for collective welfare
-   Elites then push for social services
-   State enacts social policy that promotes human development

-   Narrow Ethnic Parties
    -   Small winning coalitions
    -   Politics remains clientelistic
-   Encompassing Ethnic Parties
    -   Larger winning coalitions
    -   More social spending

## Sectarianism (Cammett)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Future movement vs. Hezbollah
    -   Future movement provides benefits across sectarian lines

    -   Whereas Hezbollah favors coethnics
-   Key reason is electoral mobilization
    -   Future Movement prioritizes winning elections
    -   Hezbollah prioritizes contentious politics (protests,
        demonstrations, or warfare)

# Agency

## Miguel Study

-   So far we have talked about how structural factors condition effects of ethnicity on service provisioning.
-   Can governments **choose** to alter incentives if they want to?
-   Tanzania vs. Kenya
    - Which country does a better job of managing ethnic diversity?
    -   What is the evidence of this?
- How do Tanzania and Kenya approach diversity differently?
  - Why is one more successful than the other?
  -  Are there lessons for other countries?

# Micro-Level Explanations 

## Which Mechanisms Are Relevant?

![Habyarimana et. al., 2007](images/table_1.1.png)

## Four Types of Games

-   Dictator game
    -   500 shilling (2 coins)
        -   Determines who is "egoist"
    -   100 shilling (10 coins)
    -   Distribute to coethnics and non-coethnics
    -   Anonymous and non-anonymous
-   Lockbox game
    -   Work together to open lock
-   Puzzle game
    -   Work together to solve puzzle
-   Network game
    -   Find and receive message from person

## Dictator Game (non-anonymous)

## Dictator Game (anonymous)

![Habyarimana et. al., 2007](images/figure_4.2.jpg)

## Basic Findings

-   No evidence of preference mechanisms

-   Weak evidence of technology mechanisms

-   Stronger evidence of strategy selection mechanisms
  - "Egoists" give to coethnics in non-anonymous game
