    -   Working conditions
    -   Safety standards
    -   Rules governing termination and promotion

-   Collective bargaining

- INGOs undemocratic, lack connection to workers

## Discussion

- How to improve union democracy?
- How to get workers more excited about organizing? 
- Alternatives to traditional labor unions?
