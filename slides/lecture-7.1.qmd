# Economic Crisis

## Elements of an Economic Crisis {style="font-size: .75em"}

-   Recession
    -   Low or negative growth rates
    -   High unemployment
-   Hyperinflation & shortages
    -   Government prints money to cover debts
    -   Hoarding
-   Balance of payments crisis
    -   Sudden stops or reversals of capital inflows
-   Debt crisis
    -   Proliferation of public debt relative to GDP
-   Financial crisis
    -   Assets bubbles

## Causes of Crisis (Neoliberal Diagnosis)

-   "Bloated" public sector
    -   Inefficient/wasteful
    -   Crowds out private sector investment
-   Corruption
    -   Deters investment generally
-   Over-regulation of private sector
    -   Impedes expansion of formal sector
-   Government spending and debt
    -   Drives inflation

# Crisis in Eastern Europe

## Economic Organization Under Communism

-   Centralized planning
    -   Bureaucratically established quotas and targets
    -   No market dynamics of supply and demand
-   Key economic goals
    -   Full employment
    -   State ownership and control
-   International isolation/autarchy

## Pitfalls of Central Planning {style="font-size: .8em"}

-   Information
    -   No price mechanisms
    -   Government is not omniscient
    -   No way to regulate supply and demand
    -   Barter economy, black markets and shortages
-   Perverse incentives
    -   No profit-maximizing behavior
    -   Lack of innovation
    -   Soft budget constraints in public sector: waste, theft, poor
        quality of goods

## Adverse Results

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Widespread theft and embezzlement of state property
-   Centralized planning system stops working
-   Escalating inflation because counties keep printing money
-   Mass shortages of even basic goods

# Crisis in India 

## India's Economic System {style="font-size: .8em"}

-   "Nehruvian" industrial policy rather than central planning
-   Import substitution
    -   Protection of domestic industry
    -   High tariffs
-   Market controls
    -   'License-Quota Raj'
-   Dominance of the public sector
    -   Low quality goods
    -   Shortages
    -   Inefficiency
    -   End result: inflation and decreased trade

## 1991 Economic Crisis

-   Proximate cause: balance of payments (BOP) crisis
-   Occurs when the total amount of receipts is less than the amount of
    total payments
-   Causes of crisis in India
    -   Collapse of Soviet Union (Trade)
    -   Gulf War (Oil)
-   Capital flight, speculative attack on credit, balance of payments
    and currency crisis

# Neoliberal Reforms

## Reform #1: Stabilization

-   Goal: prevent hyperinflation from escalating out of control
-   Austerity regime meant to curb inflation
    -   Reduce or halt public spending
    -   Curb public expectations
-   Devalue currency
-   Raise taxes and government revenue
-   Can't print money to solve the problem

## Reform #2: Liberalization

-   End price controls, production quotas, reservations, etc.
-   Encourage foreign trade and investment
    -   Reduce tariff barriers
    -   Lift curbs on foreign direct investment
    -   Goals
        -   Attract real money, which is in short supply
        -   Increase competition and innovation
        -   Spur investment in industry and high-end services

##

-   Reduce state subsidies (expensive, interfere with market forces)
    -   Cash, tax breaks, loan guarantees, procurement prices, stock
        purchases
    -   Farm, oil, housing, export, etc.
-   Financial sector reforms
    -   Allow private and foreign banks freedom to operate

## Reform #3: Privatization

-   Selling off of state assets to private actors
-   Develop greater efficiency and increase output
    -   Better managers
    -   Better incentives
-   Create markets and entrepreneurs
-   Generate revenue for the state

## Reform #4: Structural Adjustment

-   Long-term structural reform
    -   Extending neoliberal reforms
    -   Reducing government role in economy
    -   Liberalizing factor markets
        -   Land, labor, capital
-   The ultimate goal is to boost productivity
    -   Not just removing price controls or privatizing
    -   Making institutions growth-enhancing
        -   Industrial policy, investment policy, governance, etc.

# Shock Therapy vs. Gradualism

## "Shock Therapy"

-   Quick moves to stabilize the economy through an evolutionary
    approach
-   Goal of remaking economies quickly
-   Internationally-renowned teams experts sent to oversee reforms
-   Eastern Europe is a good example

## Gradualism {style="font-size: .8em"}

-   Step-by-step implementation of reforms
-   Put correct political institutions in place before revamping the
    economy
    -   Courts, tax inspectors, regulatory agencies, and financial
        intermediaries
-   Advocated by other prominent economists (Joseph Stiglitz) and
    intellectuals
-   India is a good example
    -   Fast on trade, investment and license quota raj
    -   Slow on privatization, labor law and other contentious reforms

## "Partial Reform Equilibrium"

-   Winners of early reforms blocked further progress:
    -   Benefited from access to legislation and coveted assets
    -   Created a system in between capitalism and communism where a
        select few benefitted
-   State Capture
    -   Powerful private interests asset control over both the economy
        and political decisions
    -   Think oligarchs!

## Businesses Corrupting the State

-   Innovative ways of wielding influence
    -   Buying laws outright
    -   Running for elected office
    -   Hiring the relatives of politicians
    -   Mobilizing their workers to act politically

# Discussion

## Archibong et. al. 

- What is the main hypothesis?
- What reforms are they examining in the African context?
- Quantitative analysis
  - What are they trying to show?
  - Is it convincing
- Case studies, each group take one
