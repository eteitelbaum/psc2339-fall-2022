Fiscal discipline\n2.  Public expenditure (investment vs consumption)\n3.  Tax reform (expand tax base, cut marginal rates)\n4.  Financial liberalization\n5.  Competitive exchange rates\n6.  Trade liberalization\n7.  Foreign direct investment (remove barriers)\n8.  Privatization of state-owned enterprises\n9.  Deregulation of markets\n10. Secure property rights\n\n# Economic Crisis\n\n## Elements of an Economic Crisis {style=\"font-size: .75em\"}\n\n-   Recession\n    -   Low or negative growth rates\n    -   High unemployment\n-   Hyperinflation & shortages\n    -   Government prints money to cover debts\n    -   Hoarding\n-   Balance of payments crisis\n    -   Sudden stops or reversals of capital inflows\n-   Debt crisis\n    -   Proliferation of public debt relative to GDP\n-   Financial crisis\n    -   Assets bubbles\n\n## Causes of Crisis (Neoliberal Diagnosis)\n\n-   \"Bloated\" public sector\n    -   Inefficient/wasteful\n    -   Crowds out private sector investment\n-   Corruption\n    -   Deters investment generally\n-   Over-regulation of private sector\n    -   Impedes expansion of formal sector\n-   Government spending and debt\n    -   Drives inflation\n\n# Crisis in Eastern Europe\n\n## Economic Organization Under Communism\n\n-   Centralized planning\n    -   Bureaucratically established quotas and targets\n    -   No market dynamics of supply and demand\n-   Key economic goals\n    -   Full employment\n    -   State ownership and control\n-   International isolation/autarchy\n\n## Pitfalls of Central Planning {style=\"font-size: .8em\"}\n\n-   Information\n    -   No price mechanisms\n    -   Government is not omniscient\n    -   No way to regulate supply and demand\n    -   Barter economy, black markets and shortages\n-   Perverse incentives\n    -   No profit-maximizing behavior\n    -   Lack of innovation\n    -   Soft budget constraints in public sector: waste, theft, poor\n        quality of goods\n\n## Adverse Results\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   Widespread theft and embezzlement of state property\n-   Centralized planning system stops working\n-   Escalating inflation because counties keep printing money\n-   Mass shortages of even basic goods\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![Breadline in the USSR](images/breadlines.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n# Crisis in India \n\n## India's Economic System {style=\"font-size: .8em\"}\n\n-   \"Nehruvian\" industrial policy rather than central planning\n-   Import substitution\n    -   Protection of domestic industry\n    -   High tariffs\n-   Market controls\n    -   'License-Quota Raj'\n-   Dominance of the public sector\n    -   Low quality goods\n    -   Shortages\n    -   Inefficiency\n    -   End result: inflation and decreased trade\n\n## 1991 Economic Crisis\n\n-   Proximate cause: balance of payments (BOP) crisis\n-   Occurs when the total amount of receipts is less than the amount of\n    total payments\n-   Causes of crisis in India\n    -   Collapse of Soviet Union (Trade)\n    -   Gulf War (Oil)\n-   Capital flight, speculative attack on credit, balance of payments\n    and currency crisis\n\n# Neoliberal Reforms\n\n## Reform #1: Stabilization\n\n-   Goal: prevent hyperinflation from escalating out of control\n-   Austerity regime meant to curb inflation\n    -   Reduce or halt public spending\n    -   Curb public expectations\n-   Devalue currency\n-   Raise taxes and government revenue\n-   Can't print money to solve the problem\n\n## Reform #2: Liberalization\n\n-   End price controls, production quotas, reservations, etc.\n-   Encourage foreign trade and investment\n    -   Reduce tariff barriers\n    -   Lift curbs on foreign direct investment\n    -   Goals\n        -   Attract real money, which is in short supply\n        -   Increase competition and innovation\n        -   Spur investment in industry and high-end services\n\n##\n\n-   Reduce state subsidies (expensive, interfere with market forces)\n    -   Cash, tax breaks, loan guarantees, procurement prices, stock\n        purchases\n    -   Farm, oil, housing, export, etc.\n-   Financial sector reforms\n    -   Allow private and foreign banks freedom to operate\n\n## Reform #3: Privatization\n\n-   Selling off of state assets to private actors\n-   Develop greater efficiency and increase output\n    -   Better managers\n    -   Better incentives\n-   Create markets and entrepreneurs\n-   Generate revenue for the state\n\n## Reform #4: Structural Adjustment\n\n-   Long-term structural reform\n    -   Extending neoliberal reforms\n    -   Reducing government role in economy\n    -   Liberalizing factor markets\n        -   Land, labor, capital\n-   The ultimate goal is to boost productivity\n    -   Not just removing price controls or privatizing\n    -   Making institutions growth-enhancing\n        -   Industrial policy, investment policy, governance, etc.\n\n# Shock Therapy vs. Gradualism\n\n## \"Shock Therapy\"\n\n-   Quick moves to stabilize the economy through an evolutionary\n    approach\n-   Goal of remaking economies quickly\n-   Internationally-renowned teams experts sent to oversee reforms\n-   Eastern Europe is a good example\n\n## Gradualism {style=\"font-size: .8em\"}\n\n-   Step-by-step implementation of reforms\n-   Put correct political institutions in place before revamping the\n    economy\n    -   Courts, tax inspectors, regulatory agencies, and financial\n        intermediaries\n-   Advocated by other prominent economists (Joseph Stiglitz) and\n    intellectuals\n-   India is a good example\n    -   Fast on trade, investment and license quota raj\n    -   Slow on privatization, labor law and other contentious reforms\n\n## \"Partial Reform Equilibrium\"\n\n-   Winners of early reforms blocked further progress:\n    -   Benefited from access to legislation and coveted assets\n    -   Created a system in between capitalism and communism where a\n        select few benefitted\n-   State Capture\n    -   Powerful private interests asset control over both the economy\n        and political decisions\n    -   Think oligarchs!\n\n## Businesses Corrupting the State\n\n-   Innovative ways of wielding influence\n    -   Buying laws outright\n    -   Running for elected office\n    -   Hiring the relatives of politicians\n    -   Mobilizing their workers to act politically\n\n# Effectiveness of Reforms\n\n## Transition Progress in Eastern Europe\n\n![EBRD TPI](images/ebrd.jpg)\n\n## Growth Rates in India and China\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lecture-7.1_files/figure-revealjs/growth_graph-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n## Poverty and Inequality in India\n\n::: columns\n::: column\n![Source: oxfamblogs.org](images/india_poverty.png)\n:::\n\n::: column\n![Source: Livemint](images/india_inequality.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n# Discussion\n\n## Archibong et. al. \n\n- What is the main hypothesis?\n- What reforms are they examining in the African context?\n- Quantitative analysis\n  - What are they trying to show?\n  - Is it convincing\n- Case studies, each group take one \n\n\n\n\n",
