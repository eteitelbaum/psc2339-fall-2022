They consist of both informal constraints\n(sanctions, taboos, customs, traditions and codes of conduct), and\nformal rules (constitutions, laws, property rights).\"\n\n    - *Douglas North*\n\n## Inclusive Institutions\n\n-   Inclusive institutions...\"allow and encourage participation by the\n    great mass of people in economic activities that make the best use\n    of their talents and skills and enable individuals to make the\n    choices they wish.\"\n-   *Economic*: private property, unbiased legal system, banks, legally\n    binding contracts, etc.\n-   *Political*: can take a variety of forms but must be pluralistic\n    (constrained) with centralized and powerful state\n\n## Extractive Institutions\n\n-   Extractive institutions are...\"designed to extract incomes and\n    wealth from one subset of society to benefit a different subset.\"\n-   *Economic*: limited or non-existent property rights, biased legal\n    system, slavery\n-   *Political*: absolutist, repressive, may or may not be centralized\n\n## Key Arguments\n\n-   *Hypothesis 1*: Inclusive **economic** institutions promote\n    investment and economic growth, while extractive institutions\n    discourage investment and hamper economic growth\n\n-   *Hypothesis 2*: Inclusive **political** institutions encourage the\n    development of inclusive economic institutions and vice-versa\n\n# Additional Considerations\n\n## Distribution of Authority\n\n![Acemoglu & Robinson, figure 3](images/AR_fig3.png){width=\"70%\"}\n\n::: notes\n-   Institutional change/progress depends on distributed authority\n-   Pulls power away from monarch/dictator\n-   Broad coalitions counter narrow interests\n:::\n\n## Persistence and Change\n\n-   Why do extractive institutions persist?\n    -   Industrial progress threatens the interests of dictators and\n        other elites\n    -   Polany's \"double movement\"\n    -   Schumpeter's theory of \"creative destruction\"\n-   When do institutions change?\n    -   Critical junctures (and small differences)\n    -   e.g. disease $\\rightarrow$ shift in labor market dynamics\n    -   Revolution gives a group new power\n\n::: notes\n-   A&R give the example of bubonic plague leading to shift in labor\n    market dynamics\n    -   Maybe something similar is going on with COVID?\n-   Revolution leads to assertion of power for one class or another\n    -   Glorious Revolution lead to permanent assertion of power of\n        parliament over the crown\n    -   French revolution led to greater power for lower classes,\n        established constitution that limited power of the monarchy\n    -   Other examples?\n:::\n\n## Reversal of Fortunes\n\n-   Extractive institutions make a region wealthy in one period, but\n    poor in the next\n-   Examples?\n\n::: notes\nslavery;

USSR directs resources towards productive\nsectors; while South Korea (and China) adopt inclusive political\ninstitutions\n:::\n\n## Growth Under Repressive Regimes\n\n-   Growth under extractive institutions is possible\n    -   When elite funnel resources to high productivity areas\n    -   When authoritarian regimes permit inclusive economic\n        institutions\n-   But this growth is inherently *limited*\n    -   Lack of incentives for innovation and production\n    -   Resistance to creative destruction\n    -   Infighting among the elite\n\n# Remaining Challenges\n\n## The United States\n\n![National Memorial for Peace & Justice, Source: NYT](images/peace-justice.jpg)\n\n## The United Kingdom\n\n![Girls rolling roads in India, 1930](images/child_labor.jpg)\n\n## Economic Impact of Colonialism\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Source: Maddison Project Database, version 2018.](lecture-2.1_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: notes\n-   India's fortunes as a global power declined under the British\n-   India had the world's leading economy until the 18th century\n-   India's share of the global economy feel from 24% of global GDP to\n    around 4% when the British left\n-   India saw a decline under the British until the middle of the 19th\n    century, at which point it began to grow again, but the growth was\n    uneven and steady upward growth only resumed after the British left\n-   India's economy stagnated because the British extracted raw\n    materials and sold finished products (mainly textiles and garments)\n    back to India as a captive market\n-   The British eenacted laws that prevented Indian industry from\n    competing with British imports, killing India's textile sector,\n    which it had a huge comparative advantage in before the British\n    arrived\n-   There are some caveats:\n    -   Although its GDP was lower, India grew at a faster pace under\n        the British than under the Mughals\n    -   Mughals were also pretty brutal as far as rulers go and hoarded\n        most of India's wealth\n    -   The Mughal empire was already on the decline when the British\n        came\n-   However the fact remains that the British adoped and heavily relied\n    upon extractive institutions to transfer wealth back to Britain\n:::\n\n## Endogeneity\n\n-   A relationship is \"endogenous\" when the direction of causality is\n    unclear\n-   A&R hypothesize that inclusive institutions drive development\n-   But could inclusive institutions be the result of development?\n-   Or could there be a third factor driving both?\n    -   What are some possibilities?\n\n## Exercise\n\n-   Write two or three sentences on what you found convincing about\n    A&R's theory\n-   Write two or three sentences on what you found problematic\n-   Discuss with a neighbor\n",
