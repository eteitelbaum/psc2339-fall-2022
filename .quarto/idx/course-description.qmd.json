Comparative political economy\nis one of the most active research fields in comparative politics and is\ncomprised of a wide range of research topics. Frequently the focus of\nresearch in comparative political economy is on how institutions\ninfluence economic outcomes. How, for example, do property rights\nfacilitate investment and economic growth? How do different colonial\nlegacies inhibit or promote economic performance? Sometimes, however,\ninstitutions become the dependent variable in our analysis. How does\nwealth influence regime stability? Or how does economic globalization\naffect welfare states? This course will address questions like these\nthrough an exploration of relevant literature. The syllabus emphasizes\ncurrent research agendas in political economy, and its main goal is to\nprovide students with a broad overview of contemporary debates in the\nfield.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"course-description.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","editor":"visual","theme":{"light":"cosmo","dark":"cyborg"},"mainfont":"Atkinson Hyperlegible","code-copy":true,"title":"Course Description"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
