These will not be graded but\nwill serve as the basis for a series of data assignments. More\ninformation on accessing Dataquest will be provided in class.\n\n## Class participation\n\nThis class is structured so that students have ample opportunity to\nparticipate in class discussions. Students are encouraged to voice their\nopinions both in small group settings as well as in broader class\ndiscussions and to ask clarifying questions when the need arises.\n\n## Assignments\n\n1.  Three data assignments (5% percent each)\n2.  Three exams (15% each)\n3.  Final project (40% of final grade)\n    a.  Outline and sources (10%)\n    b.  White paper (10%)\n    c.  Power BI report (20%)\n\n### Data assignments\n\nStudents will complete three graded data assignments that will be based\non the Dataquest modules covered in class. These exercises will be\noriented towards strengthening the student's ability to manipulate,\nvisualize and communicate data with Microsoft Excel and Power BI.\n\n### Exams\n\nStudents will take three non-comprehensive takehome exams. These exams\nwill test the students' knowledge of the reading material as well as\narguments, concepts, and facts presented and discussed in class. Exams\nwill be comprised some combination of multiple choice, fill in the\nblank, true or false, short answer and essay questions.\n\n### Final project\n\nEach student will complete a final project that will be developed\nthroughout the semester. The project is comprised of three components\n(an outline, a white paper and a Power BI report). The objective of this\nproject is to develop the student's ability to incorporate data into an\nanalysis of an important research topic in the field of comparative\npolitics.\n\n## Out of class preparation\n\nIn a 15-week semester, including exam week, students are expected to\nspend a minimum of 100 minutes of out-of-class work for every 50 minutes\nof direct instruction, for a minimum total of 2.5 hours a week. A\n3-credit course should include 2.5 hours of direct instruction and a\nminimum of 5 hours of independent learning or 7.5 hours per week.\n\n## Course policies\n\n### Due dates and late assignments\n\nReadings should be completed and videos watched for the day they are\nassigned. **With the exception of the third component of the final\nproject, assignments are due the Sunday after they are assigned. The\nthird component of the final project is due at 11:59 p.m. on the date of\nthe scheduled final.** (Note that this does not mean that there is final\nexam for this course. This is just the due date for the Power BI\nassignment). The official due dates are posted in the \"weekly materials\"\npage for the week that they are due.\n\nLate assignments will be accepted **with a standard penalty of three\npercentage points per day** that they are turned in after the official\ndue date. No exceptions will be made to this policy.\n\nIf you are having a personal or medical emergency and are wondering what\nto do, start by referencing [this\nFAQ](https://studentlife.gwu.edu/student-support-faqs) published by [GW\nStudent Life](https://studentlife.gwu.edu/). Or just reach out to the\nCARE Team at [gwcares\\@gwu.edu](mailto:gwcares@gwu.edu). For further\ninformation about different types of support available to you, see the\n[course support](\\course-support.qmd) page.\n\nWhile I will always try to be a source of support to my students, please\nnote that for privacy reasons, the Provost has asked that faculty do not\nattempt to verify personal or medical emergencies themselves.\n\n### Make-ups\n\nThere are no makeups. Please see the late assignments policy above.\n\n### Attendance\n\nThis is an in-person class and you are expected to attend. While there\nis no formal attendance requirement, it is a proven fact that students\nwho attend class tend to perform better on exams and assignments. Also,\nthe instructor will not provide \"makeup sessions\" to go over material\nthat was missed due to absence.\n\n### Grading scale\n\n| Range  | Letter Grade |\n|:------:|:------------:|\n| 94-100 |      A       |\n| 90-93  |      A-      |\n| 87-89  |      B+      |\n| 84-86  |      B       |\n| 80-83  |      B-      |\n| 77-79  |      C+      |\n| 74-76  |      C       |\n| 70-73  |      C-      |\n| 67-69  |      D+      |\n| 64-66  |      D       |\n| 60-63  |      D-      |\n|  \\<59  |      F       |\n\n### Class recordings\n\nAll classes will be recorded. Recordings will be posted on the course\nBlackboard site.\n\n### Lateness\n\nPlease come to class on time. It is distracting to me and to other\nstudents when you enter the room late.\n\n### Laptops and cell phones\n\nPlease put away your cell phones during class. It is fine to use\ncomputers to take notes, but you should refrain from checking social\nmedia and email.\n\n### Diversity in the classroom\n\nWe want to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to participate in\nclass and to get the most out of their learning experience at GW.\nMoreover, we all benefit from a diversity of views in the classroom.\nTherefore, please be respectful of other people's views and be mindful\nof when others are trying to participate.\n\n### Learning Needs\n\nPlease let me know if you have any special needs or learning\nrequirements and so that I can accommodate them.\n\n### Email\n\nI try to respond to emails within 24 hours except on weekends. It is\nusually preferred to talk to me in person, however, either after class\nor during office hours.\n\n### Food\n\nStudents are permitted to eat light snacks, but please refrain from\nbringing sugary drinks, coffee or large, odiferous meals.\n\n## University policies\n\n### Academic integrity\n\nBy taking this course, you are agreeing to abide by the [GWU code of\nAcademic\nIntegrity](http://studentconduct.gwu.edu/code-academic-integrity).\nAccording to this code, academic dishonesty is defined as \"cheating of\nany kind, including misrepresenting one's own work, taking credit for\nthe work of others without crediting them and without appropriate\nauthorization, and the fabrication of information.\" Note that this is\nnot a comprehensive list. Other types of academic dishonesty include\nproviding false or misleading information in an effort to postpone an\nexam or to get an extension on an assignment and providing substantially\nsimilar material for a writing assignment for assignments in two\ndifferent courses without the prior permission of the faculty members\nteaching those courses. The minimum penalty for academic dishonesty is a\nfailing grade on the assignment in question and the maximum penalty is\nfailure of the class. Furthermore, the violation will be reported to\nGW's Office of Academic Integrity, which can impose additional penalties\nbeyond those I may impose.\n\n### Religious holidays\n\nStudents must notify faculty during the first week of the semester in\nwhich they are enrolled in the course, or as early as possible, but no\nlater than three weeks prior to the absence, of their intention to be\nabsent from class on their day(s) of religious observance. If the\nholiday falls within the first three weeks of class, the student must\ninform faculty in the first week of the semester. For details and\npolicy, see [\"Religious\nHolidays.\"](https://provost.gwu.edu/policies-procedures-and-guidelines.)\n\n### Use of electronic materials and class recordings\n\nStudents are encouraged to use electronic course materials, including\nrecorded class sessions, for private personal use in connection with\ntheir academic program of study. Electronic course materials and\nrecorded class sessions should not be shared or used for non-course\nrelated purposes unless express permission has been granted by the\ninstructor. Students who impermissibly share any electronic course\nmaterials are subject to discipline under the Student Code of Conduct.\nPlease contact the instructor if you have questions regarding what\nconstitutes permissible or impermissible use of electronic course\nmaterials and/or recorded class sessions.
